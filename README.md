[View the live project here.](https://blynch11.github.io/milestone2-yearbook/)


This website was created as an in house virtual yearbook option for my school. Given the year that we have all experienced, and the movement to a virtual world, I created this so that our students can have somewhere digital to look back
on their years in our school. This is something practical for me and my school and I plan on using this site for my students. It is a responsive & easy to navigate site with images, stories and highlights from the school year. It also includes
an enquiry form for other schools that may follow suit in the future. Due to the various GDPR regulations I have used 'stock images', fake names, quotes and student locations. 


## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

1. As a First Time Visitor and past pupil/relative, I want to easily navigate the site, find & read about my daughter and her fellow graduates.
2. I want to be able to expand and collapse each student card to read their quotes
3. I want to be able to see pictures of my daughter and her fellow graduates
4. I want to see highlights from the school year
5. I want to be able to view the websites that the students made in their final year in Mount Anville
6. If interested in registering for a virtual yearbook for my school, I want to easily contact the site owner for more details

     -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

- As a Returning Visitor, I want to be understand the layout of the site easily explain its Features to friends/parents/grandparents

     -   #### Frequent User Goals

As a Frequent User, I want to easily check on my friends quotes, pictures & other info on the site

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme

            - The main colours I used for my white and Teal. These colours are not only complimentary, but are actually the colours of my school. I want the site to reflect our school and it's values and ethos, hence my colour selection and the use of the school logo & flower

 -   #### Typography

            - The two types of font used are Cinzel & Yanone Kaffeesatz (YK). Cinzel is used for headers and navigation while YK is used for the paragraph text. I really like Cinzel for my headings as its elegance relfects that of our school. The script feels quite old and traditional
while also elegant and dramatic. Mount Anville is a school steeped in tradition and history, which this font suits perfectly. YK is a little less formal and an easy read for any visitors of the site. I think it compliments the Cinzel quite well. 

-   #### Imagery

Imagery is an important part of my site. I anticipate students using this site in years to come and being able to look back on themselves as graduates will be both nostalgic and humerous. I also included images of our school crest and flower, both important
parts of our school culture & a 'highlights' gallery that students can slide through to relive some of their favourite memories in school.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section 


-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

1. As a First Time Visitor and past pupil/relative, I want to easily navigate the site, find & read about my daughter and her fellow graduates.

1.1. Upon opening the site, users are greeted with an easily legible navigation menu, short story about the school year and with a simple scroll they can see the first student profile. This site is self-intuitive and users will realize that they simply
scroll further to see more students. 

<img src="/documentation/example1.png">


2. I want to be able to expand and collapse each student card to read their quotes

2.1. The read more button clearly stands out beneath each students profile and calls out to the user to 'click' and read more about the student in question.

<img src="/documentation/example2.png">

3. I want to be able to see pictures of my daughter and her fellow graduates

3.1. Each of the student profiles are clearly viisble and easy to find across all devices. Visitors can also view the gallery in the 'highlights' section - which is also included in the navigation

4. I want to see highlights from the school year

4.1. As above, the highlights section can be accessed via the nav bar, or by simply scrolling to the bottom of the page. 

5. I want to be able to view the websites that the students made in their final year in Mount Anville

5.1 Graduate students created websites as one of their final year projects. Links to these projects are available in each students profile card, beneath their quotes. (links aren't yet available as students are still working on their projects. Once completed, they will be added and will open in a new tab target="_blank" see example2 pic)

6. If interested in registering for a virtual yearbook for my school, I want to easily contact the site owner for more details

6.1 The Contact form is at the bottom of the site (also included in Nav) and requires minimal user input. 

<img src="/documentation/example3.png">


-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

1. I want to be understand the layout of the site easily explain its Features to friends/parents/grandparents

1.1 As a Returning Visitor, I will easily be able to find my way around the website as it is all contained on one page, and each section is clearly labeled. Buttons are included in bright colours where applicable. 
This simplicity will help older relatives use the site to see their grand childs yearbook. 

Frequent User Goals - As a Frequent User, I want to easily check on my friends quotes, pictures & other info on the site.

As above, the simplicity of the site allows frequent users to interact with the site with minimal effort.


### Further Testing


- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung S7, Huawei & iPhone.
- Testing was undertaken to ensure that each of the buttons works correctly as well as the map, gallery & contact form. 
- Friends & Colleagues tested the site to offer second opionions. All were happy - especially my Colleagues who look forward to seeing the site in action when our students graduate next year.
