This website was created as an in house virtual yearbook option for my school. Given the year that we have all experienced, and the movement to a virtual world, I created this so that our students can have somewhere digital to look back
on their years in our school. This is something practical for me and my school and I plan on using this site for my students. It is a responsive & easy to navigate site with images, stories and highlights from the school year. It also includes
an enquiry form for other schools that may follow suit in the future. Due to the various GDPR regulations I have used 'stock images', fake names, quotes and student locations.

Design
Colour Scheme
The main colours I used for my white and Teal. These colours are not only complimentary, but are actually the colours of my school. I want the site to reflect our school and it's values and ethos, hence my colour selection and the use of the school logo & flower
The two types of font used are Cinzel & Yanone Kaffeesatz (YK). Cinzel is used for headers and navigation while YK is used for the paragraph text. I really like Cinzel for my headings as its elegance relfects that of our school. The script feels quite old and traditional
while also elegant and dramatic. Mount Anville is a school steeped in tradition and history, which this font suits perfectly. YK is a little less formal and an easy read for any visitors of the site. I think it compliments the Cinzel quite well. 
Imagery is an important part of my site. I anticipate students using this site in years to come and being able to look back on themselves as graduates will be both nostalgic and humerous. I also included images of our school crest and flower, both important
parts of our school culture. 



Imagery is a very important part of my site. I am trying to sell the customers scenic tours around Dublin, so I chose to have a big, bold hero image of Dublin City to greet new & returning customers to the site. I added a gallery and some overhead shots of the routes to show the customer what they can expect to experience on a DCC tour.

First Time Visitor Goals
As a First Time Visitor and prospective customer, I want to easily understand what tours this site offers for cyclists looking to explore Dublin

1.1. Upon landing on the site customers can see a snapshot of what to expect during a tour on our large hero image. A simple scroll will offer them more info about DCC and the routes page will give more details about the routes we offer.


I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find the tour that suits me and my party best.

2.1. The ever present nav-bar makes navigation easy for potential customers. 2.2. Footer links are also available for customers on each page.

I want to be able to see pictures of the routes & bikes to get a taste for what a tour might be like.

3.1. The routes page of the site contains a detailed description of each route, along with a picture of that route. 3.2. The routes page also contains a gallery of vivid images of the four routes.


I want to see previous customer testimonials and reviews.

4.1. The testimonials page allows customers to hear about previous customers experiences on the tour. 4.2. There are also links to our social media account where potential customers can hear more about previous customers experiences.


Returning Visitor Goals
As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to rebook easily and follow DCC on social media.

1.1. Returning visitors will be able to rebook a tour in a matter of seconds, via the 'book now' call to action button the home page hero image. 1.2. Alternatively, returning visitors can navigate throughout the site at ease if further research of routes is required before rebooking. This can be done by engaging the nav-bar at the top of the page or using the link to routes at the bottom of the home page. 1.3. Following us on social media couldn't be easier, with links to all of our accounts available at the bottom of every page of the site.
